Directly Rendered Option Interface for DFX

![](./screenshot.png?raw=true)

This takes the [`clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) options from [`dfx`](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk) and renders them using [`klask`](https://github.com/MichalGniadek/klask).

I don't plan to work on this beyond what's here but perhaps it will inspire someone to take the idea further.
